Strain Loop
A matlab program for calculation hysteris curves for magnetic thin films

StrainLoop uses a Stoner-Wohlfarth type model to produce hysteresis curves.

The miniumum energy is found by rotating the direction of magnetisation.

The applied magnetic field can be swept to produce a hystersis loop.

Also included is a domain wall energy which allows the magnetisation to snap between angles if it reduces the energy by less than E_DW to do so.

Program will plot hystersis loops.

Energyy terms included:
- Zeeman
- Magnetocrystalline: cubic and uniaxial
- Strain
